API FOR FLAGS can be found here

To do: 

Update the populate database script and models to accomodate information from the API. 
Integrate Folium and present the countries on a map 
within a wrapper on the page. 

Clean up the UI a bit and then call it. 

Next project can be to crate a UI with react (EY).
